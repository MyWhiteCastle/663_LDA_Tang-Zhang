    "The data that we will be using in this project is part of LDA-C, which is a C implementation of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). The data is composed of three parts: a 1.3-megabytes corpus of text documents, a standard list of stop words (words like \"the\", \"a\" and etc. that are supposed to be removed from being considered as words under topics), and a list of unique vocabularies that occur in the texts. The main corpus that we perform the analyses on comprises of 500 documents from the Associated Press."
